# The BAD Lab (Binghamton Ancient DNA Lab)

Our lab investigates ancient human migration, ancestry, health, and identity through cutting-edge biomolecular research.

Integrating ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis, stable isotope science, and archaeological context, our lab reconstructs past lifeways across the Nile Valley, the Mediterranean, and beyond.

Our work connects anthropology, archaeology, molecular biology, and computational genomics to uncover how populations moved, adapted, and interacted through deep time.

# Current research projects include:

- Genomic and isotopic reconstruction of migration pathways in ancient Nubia and Upper Egypt

- Investigation of health, disease, and diet in Roman and post-Roman populations

- Development of new methods for authenticating degraded ancient DNA

- Establishment of regional isotopic baselines for the Nile Valley and North Africa

The BAD Lab is committed to rigorous laboratory practices, ethical ancient DNA research, and collaborative field partnerships across the globe. We welcome undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers who are excited about exploring humanity's shared genetic past through interdisciplinary science.

 # Our Focus

1. Ancient DNA (mitochondrial, nuclear, pathogen aDNA)
2. Stable isotope analysis (strontium, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen)
3. Paleogenomics and bioarchaeology
4. Computational analysis and ancient population genetics
5. Methodological innovation in ancient DNA authentication and analysis
