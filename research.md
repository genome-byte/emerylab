# Research Focus Areas

### Migration and Mobility in the Nile Valley

Using aDNA and isotopic signatures, we reconstruct the movement of ancient populations in Nubia, Upper Egypt, and surrounding regions, from the Kerma period through the Medieval era.

### Diet, Health, and Disease in Ancient Societies

Through genomic and isotopic analysis, we explore health conditions, disease patterns, and dietary strategies across ancient Nile communities.

### Methodological Innovation in Ancient DNA

We develop and test new methods for ancient DNA extraction, damage authentication, low-coverage genome imputation, and isotopic baseline modeling.

### Collaborative Field and Laboratory Research

We maintain active collaborations with archaeologists, museums, and scientific partners across North Africa, the Mediterranean, and beyond.
