# Welcome!!!

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; flex-wrap: wrap;">

<div style="flex: 2; padding-right: 20px; min-width: 250px;">

At the BAD Lab, we uncover the ancient past using ancient DNA (aDNA), isotope analysis, and bioarchaeology.

Our research spans the Nile Valley, the Mediterranean, and beyond â€” decoding migration, health, and ancestry through molecular science.

**Learn more about how ancient molecules tell ancient stories.**
