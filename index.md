# Welcome to the BAD Lab

At the BAD Lab, we uncover the ancient past using ancient DNA (aDNA), isotope analysis, and bioarchaeology.

Our research spans the Nile Valley, the Mediterranean, and beyond â€” decoding migration, health, and ancestry through molecular science.

**Learn more about how ancient molecules tell ancient stories.**
