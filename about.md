# About the BAD Lab

At the Binghamton Ancient DNA Lab (BAD Lab), we explore humanity's deep past through the powerful combination of ancient DNA (aDNA), stable isotope analysis, and archaeological science.  
Our research bridges molecular biology, anthropology, and archaeology to answer fundamental questions about migration, ancestry, health, and adaptation.

The BAD Lab specializes in the ancient populations of the Nile Valley, the Mediterranean, and surrounding regions — investigating how people moved, mixed, and lived across dynamic landscapes.

### Lab Director
- **Dr. Matthew Emery**, Assistant Professor of Anthropology, Binghamton University
